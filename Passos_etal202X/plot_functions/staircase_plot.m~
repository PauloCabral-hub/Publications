% staircase_plot(chan_info, topo_mat, new_fig)
%
% DESCRIPTION: plots a topographical map of the head where boxes appear in
% the position of each channel. Inside each box, a number appears
% referenced to a tree. Each box in a given channel position indicates the
% tree retrieved for that block. Boxes at the bottom indicates the first
% block, and at the top, last block.
%
% INPUT:
%
% chan_inf = channel information structure in the form of EEGlab
% topo_mat = a matrix with the numbers referenced to the trees.
% Different lines indicates different channels. Difference collumns
% indicates different blocks.
% new_fig = if set to 1, creates a figure for the plot.
